    <h2>
        Introduction
    </h2>
    
        <p>
            This document describes an <strong>vocabulary</strong>, in this case <strong>Core Vocabularies</strong>. 
	    A vocabulary is a semantic data specification designed so that the included terms are highly reusable.
	    The included classes and properties come with a limited set of constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
	    This allows them to be used in a broad range of use cases. This document focuses on ADMS, which is a profile of DCAT used to describe semantic assets, such as metadata and reference data. ADMS is designed for those
        searching for a document-like asset that can be easily opened and read using familiar desktop software, rather than a dataset that needs to be processed. Although there are overlaps between assets and datasets, the
        difference in user expectation is at the core of what distinguishes ADMS from DCAT. Moreover, while DCAT is centred on facilitating interoperability between data catalogues, ADMS focuses on the assets within a 
        catalogue.
        </p>

<p>
    The Core Business Vocabulary provides a minimum set of classes and properties for
    legal entities, that is, trading bodies that are formally registered with the relevant authority and that appear in
    business registers. This excludes sole traders, virtual organisations and other types of 'agents'
    that are able to do business.

<h2>
   External terms
</h2>
This section lists the classes and properties that are mapped on external URIs.
Either these are reused as-is, i.e. with no formal additional constraints compared to those retrievable via dereferencing the URI, or they are reused with terminological changes, i.e. having additional changes restricting the use to the needs of this vocabulary context.
