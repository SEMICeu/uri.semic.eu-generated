        Introduction
    </h2>
    
        <p>
            This document describes an <strong>vocabulary</strong>, in this case <strong>ADMS Vocabulary</strong>. 
	    A vocabulary is a semantic data specification designed so that the included terms are highly reusable.
	    The included classes and properties come with a limited set of constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
	    This allows them to be used in a broad range of use cases. This document focuses on ADMS, which is a profile of DCAT used to describe semantic assets, such as metadata and reference data. ADMS is designed for those
        searching for a document-like asset that can be easily opened and read using familiar desktop software, rather than a dataset that needs to be processed. Although there are overlaps between assets and datasets, the
        difference in user expectation is at the core of what distinguishes ADMS from DCAT. Moreover, while DCAT is centred on facilitating interoperability between data catalogues, ADMS focuses on the assets within a 
        catalogue.

    <h2>
        Conformance
    </h2>
        <p>
            Regarding conformity, all the authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are not normative, along with sections marked as non-normative.
            Everything else is normative, and the key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL are interpreted as defined in [[RFC2119]].
        </p>
        <p>
            If a data interchange meets the following conditions, irrespective of how the interchange takes place, it is considered conformant with ADMS if:
	    <ul>
            <li>the terms (classes and properties) from ADMS are utilised in a manner that aligns with their semantics as specified in ADMS;</li>
            <li>it does not use terms from other vocabularies instead of ones defined in this vocabulary that could reasonably be used (use of such terms in addition to ADMS is permissible).</li>
	    </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            A data interchange conforming to ADMS:
	    <ul>
            <li>MAY include terms of other vocabularies;</li>
            <li>MAY use only a subset of ADMS terms.</li>
	    </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            An ADMS profile is a specification that imposes additional constraints on data interchange. These restrictions may encompass, but are not restricted to:
	    <ul>
            <li>a minimum set of required terms;</li>
            <li>classes and properties for additional terms not covered in ADMS;</li>
            <li>controlled vocabularies or URI sets as acceptable values for properties;</li>
            <li>specific concrete protocols, formats, and syntaxes.</li>
	    </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Although RDF and XML are preferred, ADMS is agnostic to technology, and the terms defined in the document can be encoded in any technology by publishers.

<h2>
   External terms
</h2>
This section lists the classes and properties that are mapped on external URIs.
Either these are reused as-is, i.e. with no formal additional constraints compared to those retrievable via dereferencing the URI, or they are reused with terminological changes, i.e. having additional changes restricting the use to the needs of this vocabulary context.

  <section class="informative">
<h2>Motivation for this change</h2>

<p>
This new release of ADMS will decouple ADMS from DCAT for the terms in the vocabulary.
Doing so the lifecycle of ADMS is not anymore bound to the lifecyle of DCAT. 
With the active development of DCAT and its profiles, the status of ADMS as profile of DCAT becomes unclear.
The impact of DCAT on the ADMS vocabulary as profile of DCAT is not only on its relationship, but also on how the profile is constructed and on the adoption of some terminology.
For instance, ADMS has some versioning navigation properties, but those are not adopted by DCAT but replaced by similar properties in the DCAT namespace.
All these changes to the base vocabulary DCAT, of which ADMS declared itself originally a profile of, force a regular adaption of ADMS.
</p><p>
With this new release ADMS is decoupled to the furtest extend possible from DCAT (no formal ties), while maintaining its original definitions.
In essence one can consider this as a broadening of the ADMS terms.
</p><p>

While this independence offers new potential for reuse, the goal is not to create a parallell universe to DCAT.
As such it is high recommended in order to use ADMS in full, to first create a DCAT profile with the ADMS terms included.
This means that although some ADMS classes and properties are not deprecated, the newly created DCAT profile will adhere first to DCAT, and only use the ADMS terms that are fit for purpose for the profile. 
The historic depencency should facilitate the creation of such profile easily. 


</p>
</section>

<section class="informative">
<h1>ADMS as DCAT profile</h1>

ADMS was originally very tight with DCAT integrated. 
As explained in the introduction (XXX REF), this version has decoupled ADMS from DCAT.

In this section, the base principles for building an ADMS based profile of DCAT are given.

<ul>
   <li>The main classes adms:AssetRepository, adms:Asset and adms:AssetDistribution are defined as subclasses of dcat:Catalog, dcat:Dataset and dcat:Distribution. </li>
   <li>The properties adms:last, adms:next, adms:prev have dcat:last, dcat:next, dcat:prev counterparts. It is recommended to use these. </li>
   <li>Use the relations dcat:dataset (or the more generic dcat:resource) and dcat:distribution to interconnect adms:AssetRepository, adms:Asset and adms:AssetDistibution. </li>
</ul>

The last principle is to reflect on the usage of the properties of DCAT. 
Hereunder is are the properties that were included in the original ADMS with their profile interpretation. 

<h2>
   Reused terms from DCAT
</h2>
This section lists the classes and properties that are mapped on external URIs.
Either these are reused as-is, i.e. with no formal additional constraints compared to those retrievable via dereferencing the URI, or they are reused with terminological changes, i.e. having additional changes restricting the use to the needs of this vocabulary context.
