    <h2>
        Introduction
    </h2>
    
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
This document has been prepared in the context of Action 1.1 – Improving semantic interoperability in European eGovernment systems  of the European Commission’s Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) programme [[ISA]].
</p><p>
Studies conducted on behalf of the European Commission  show that businesses and citizens still face difficulties in finding and re-using public sector information. In its communication on Open Data  of 12 December 2011, the European Commission states that the availability of the information in a machine-readable format as well as a thin layer of commonly agreed metadata could facilitate data cross-reference and interoperability and therefore considerably enhance its value for reuse.
</p><p>
Much of the public sector information that would benefit from interoperability is published as datasets in data portals. Therefore, an agreement on a common format for data exchange would support the sharing, discovery and re-use of this data.
</p><p>
This document is the result of the major semantic change release process described in the Change and Release Management Policy for DCAT-AP  and was built starting from DCAT-AP version 1.2.1 [[dcat-ap-20190528]]. 
</p>

<p class="ednote" title="Editorial changes">
This html document is based on the orginal text provided by DCAT-AP version 2.1.1 expressed as a PDF document. 
This transition also included the additional information residing as documents in the GitHub respository on the validation and usage guidelines on Datasets, Distributions and Data Services.
So that a single document is created with all the information and guidelines available for DCAT-AP.
<br/>
From that basis, the changes that were agreed during webinar of 23 Nov 2023 are being applied. This results in a version 2.1.2 with minor updates.
<br/>
In addition to these changes, editorial changes have been applied to take benefit from the HTML representation to improve the readibility.
</p>


<h3>Scope of the revision</h3>
<p>
The objective of this work is to produce an updated release of the DCAT Application Profile based on numerous requests for change coming from real-world implementations of the specification listed on github since the previous release.  
</p><p>
The Application Profile specified in this document is based on the specification of the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) [[vocab-dcat-2]] developed under the responsibility of the Government Linked Data Working Group  at W3C. DCAT is an RDF  vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogues published on the Web. Additional classes and properties from other well-known vocabularies are re-used where necessary.
</p><p>
The work does not cover implementation issues like mechanisms for exchange of data and expected behaviour of systems implementing the Application Profile other than what is defined in the Conformance Statement in section [[[#conformance]]].
</p><p>
The Application Profile is intended to facilitate data exchange and therefore the classes and properties defined in this document are only relevant for the data to be exchanged; there are no requirements for communicating systems to implement specific technical environments. The only requirement is that the systems can export and import data in RDF in conformance with this Application Profile.
</p>

<h3>The DCAT specification</h3>
The DCAT Application Profile defined in this document is based on the specification of the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) of 16 January 2014 , and the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) - Version 2, W3C Recommendation 04 February 2020 [[vocab-dcat-2]].

<h2>Conformance Statement</h2>


<p class="ednote" title="To Be investigated">
The bullet points on the categories must be reflected on as they are referring in business terminology to dataset themes (or wider categories) while mappingwise they are SKOS. 
It is thus unclear if these requirements apply to a subset or to all codelists.
</p>

<h3>Provider requirements</h3>
In order to conform to this Application Profile, an application that provides metadata MUST:
<ul>
<li>Provide a description of the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified for the class <a href="#Catalogue">Catalogue</a>.</li>
<li>Provide information for the mandatory properties for <a href="#CatalogueRecord">Catalogue Records</a>, if descriptions of Catalogue Records are provided – please note that the provision of descriptions of Catalogue Records is optional.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties for the class <a href="#Dataset">Dataset</a>.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of Distributions, if any, of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties for the class <a href="#Distribution">Distribution</a>.</li>

<li>Provide descriptions of Data Services, if any, of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties for the class <a href="#DataService">Data Service</a>.</li>

<li>Provide descriptions of all organisations involved in the descriptions of Catalogue and Datasets, including at least the mandatory properties for the class <a href="#Agent">Agent</a>.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of all category schemes that contain the categories that are asserted in any of the descriptions of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified for <a href="#Conceptscheme">Conceptscheme</a>.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of all categories involved in the descriptions of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified for <a href="#Concept">Concept</a>.</li>
</ul>
For the properties listed in the table in section [[[#controlled-vocs]]], the associated controlled vocabularies MUST be used. Additional controlled vocabularies MAY be used.
In addition to the mandatory properties, any of the recommended and optional properties defined in section [[[#quick-reference]]] MAY be provided.
<h3>Receiver requirements</h3>
In order to conform to this Application Profile, an application that receives metadata MUST be able to:
<li>Process information for all classes and properties specified in section [[[#quick-reference]]].</li>
<li>Process information for all controlled vocabularies specified in section [[[#controlled-vocs]]].</li>
"Processing" means that receivers must accept incoming data and transparently provide these data to applications and services. 
It does neither imply nor prescribe what applications and services finally do with the data (parse, convert, store, make searchable, display to users, etc.).

<section id="specterminology">
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>
An <strong>Application Profile</strong> is a specification that re-uses terms from one or more base standards, adding more specificity by identifying mandatory, recommended and optional elements to be used for a particular application, as well as recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used.
</p><p>
A <strong>Dataset</strong> is a collection of data, published or curated by a single source, and available for access or download in one or more formats.
A <strong>Data Portal</strong> is a Web-based system that contains a data catalogue with descriptions of datasets and provides services enabling discovery and re-use of the datasets.
In the following sections, classes and properties are grouped under headings ‘mandatory’, ‘recommended’ and ‘optional’. These terms have the following meaning.
<ul>
<li>Mandatory property: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender MUST provide the information for that property.</li>
<li>Recommended property: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender SHOULD provide the information for that property if it is available.</li>
<li>Optional property: a receiver MUST be able to process the information for that property; a sender MAY provide the information for that property but is not obliged to do so.</li>
<li>Deprecated property: a receiver SHOULD be able to process information about instances of that property; a sender SHOULD NOT provide the information about instances of that property.</li>
</ul>
The meaning of the terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD and MAY in this section and in the following sections are as defined in RFC 2119 [rfc2119].
In the given context, the term "processing" means that receivers must accept incoming data and transparently provide these data to applications and services. It does neither imply nor prescribe what applications and services finally do with the data (parse, convert, store, make searchable, display to users, etc.).

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
<p>
DCAT-AP is a DCAT profile for sharing information about Catalogues containing Datasets and Data Services descriptions in Europe. The core classes of the Application Profile are thus the classes Catalogue, Dataset, Distribution and Data Service. DCAT-AP allows Catalogues of only Datasets, but also Catalogues of only Data Services, but usually it will be a mixture of both.
</p><p>
The properties of the core classes may enforce the existence of other classes. One such important class is the class Agent. However in contrast to the core classes, DCAT-AP leaves a lot of freedom to the implementors to shape them to their needs. Only minimal expectations are expressed by DCAT-AP.
</p><p>
Elaborated statements about the expectations are found in section [[[#conformance]]] describing DCAT-AP conformance.
</p><p>
To improve the coherency between shared Dataset, Distribution and Data Service, DCAT-AP provides additional guidelines found in this document. 

</p><p>
The list of included properties contain a selection of the properties from the W3C DCAT 2.0 specification [[vocab-dcat-2]]  on which DCAT-AP expresses additional constraints or on which DCAT-AP wants to emphasize their usage. Any property that is mentioned in DCAT applicable to a class but not explicitly is listed DCAT-AP is considered an optional field for DCAT-AP for that class. It means that for these properties DCAT-AP has no use cases that require additional usage considerations beyond ‘use the property as DCAT specifies’.
</p>

<h3>Application profile diagram</h3>

An overview of DCAT-AP is shown by the UML diagram below. The UML diagram illustrates the specification described in this document. For readability purposes the representation has been condensed as follows:
<ul>
<li> no ranges for data properties are shown, because some of them are expressed as unions of XSD types</li>
<li> The figure contain the key classes with some important supporting classes. Other object properties (relationships) are listed as properties on the UML class with there target range.</li>
<li> The class dcat:Resource has been included to ease to see the connection with W3C DCAT. DCAT-AP treats it as an abstract notion. </li>
</ul>
The cardinalities and qualifications are included in the figure.

  <h2>Controlled Vocabularies</h2>

<h3>Requirements for controlled vocabularies</h3>
The following is a list of requirements that were identified for the controlled vocabularies to be recommended in this Application Profile.
Controlled vocabularies SHOULD:
<ul>
<li>Be published under an open licence.</li>
<li>Be operated and/or maintained by an institution of the European Union, by a recognised standards organisation or another trusted organisation.</li>
<li>Be properly documented.</li>
<li>Have labels in multiple languages, ideally in all official languages of the European Union.</li>
<li>Contain a relatively small number of terms (e.g. 10-25) that are general enough to enable a wide range of resources to be classified.</li>
<li>Have terms that are identified by URIs with each URI resolving to documentation about the term.</li>
<li>Have associated persistence and versioning policies.</li>
</ul>
These criteria do not intend to define a set of requirements for controlled vocabularies in general; they are only intended to be used for the selection of the controlled vocabularies that are proposed for this Application Profile.

<h3>Controlled vocabularies to be used</h3>
In the table below, a number of properties are listed with controlled vocabularies that MUST be used for the listed properties. The declaration of the following controlled vocabularies as mandatory ensures a minimum level of interoperability.

<h3>Other controlled vocabularies</h3>
In addition to the proposed common vocabularies in section 5.2, which are mandatory to ensure minimal interoperability, implementers are encouraged to publish and to use further region or domain-specific vocabularies that are available online. While those may not be recognised by general implementations of the Application Profile, they may serve to increase interoperability across applications in the same region or domain. Examples are the full set of concepts in EuroVoc, the CERIF standard vocabularies, the Dewey Decimal Classification and numerous other schemes.

<h3>Licence vocabularies</h3>
  <p class="ednote" title="Old text from the previous release: proposed to delete">
Concerning licence vocabularies, implementers are encouraged to use widely recognised licences such as Creative Commons licences, and in particular the CC Zero Public Domain Dedication, the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL), the European Union Public Licence (EUPL) or an open government licence such as the UK Open Government Licence.
Further activities in this area are undertaken by the Open Data Institute with the Open Data Rights Statement Vocabulary and by the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) Initiative.

  <h2>Legal information</h2>

<p>

Providing correct and sufficient legal information is important to create trust by candidate reusers.
Without explicit legal information there is a risk involved in the reuse of data, because one has no way of knowing what is allowed. 
While in the past legislation and initiatives such as Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data stress the importance of this information, 
recent legislations, such as the High Value Datasets regulation, have become more demanding by imposing a minimum level of reuse.
As general principle, it is recommended that publishers consult their legal services to provide the appropriate values.

<p></p>
Within DCAT-AP properties licence, rights and access rights are used to share this information. 
The basic guidelines for their usage are expressed in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#license-rights">License and Rights statements</a> guideline in DCAT.
DCAT-AP implementers SHOULD consult these, in addition with the additional advices for the DCAT-AP usage context provided in this section.

<p></p>

The general principle is that licences, rights and access rights are expressions in the context of a legislation. 
It is possible (and allowed) that a EU Member State prescribes specific licences to be used for data published by the public sector.
And thus, publishers of that EU Member State will use that in the metadata descriptions.
This diversity can be considered a hurdle for cross-border reuse, as the implications of the licence might not be understood by users from another EU Member State.

<p></p>
This creates a natural tendency to use licences (or rights) which have a wider adoption that national legislation.
Unless restricted by national legislation, implementers are encouraged for that reason to use widely recognised licences such as Creative Commons licences.
In particular it is advised for FAIR data to consider CC BY 4.0 (the minimum limit set by the HVD regulation) or more permissive such as licences CC Zero.

<p></p>

An assessment of data.europa.eu [[DEU]] in 2023 showed that there are different representations to indicate the same licence.
To create a more harmonised experience throughout Europe, it is recommended to use the <a href="http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/licence">NAL licence</a>
maintained by the Publications Office if allowed by national legislation.
If local representations are used, then the equivalence with a licence in this NAL should be provided.
This mapping is expressed as metadata to local representation.
Note that this mapping is not determining the reuse conditions; the legal binding reuse conditions are those that are directly associated with the Distribution or Data Service.
Nevertheless, by applying this recommendation, it is possible for a cross-border reuser to get an insight in the reuse conditions without a detailed understanding the local legislation.

<p></p>
To encourage publishers to provide legal information DCAT-AP recommendes to provide licence information. 
However, in some EU Member States, the term licence has a specific interpretation; in that interpretation the to-be provided legal information cannot be supplied as a document for property <a href="TODO">licence</a>.
In those legislative contexts it is advised to translate this encouragement in appropriate metadata guidelines for the targeted publishers.
For instance, such guidelines could state that one must use a set of rights to document the reuse conditions.


<p></p>
Since legal information may vary per distribution or service, DCAT-AP has adopted from its conception, the strategy to <b>only</b> express legal information at the most concrete level of sharing, i.e. Distribution or Data Service.
Suppose licensing information is also given on the Dataset level, there is a possibility that this is in conflict with licensing information on the Distribution, in which case it cannot be established which licence takes precedence.
By this strategy, the need for a conflict resolution between legal information at the level of a Dataset (or Dataset Series) and its associated Distributions or Data Services is avoided.


<p></p>
Despite the above examples provided here are a perfect fit for those that are in scope of 'Open Data', they apply also for data that is beyond the scope of 'Open Data'.
E.g. the Data Governance Act requires to provide sufficient legal reuse information such as the fees that apply.

<h2>Conformance Statement</h2>


<p class="ednote" title="To Be investigated">
The bullet points on the categories must be reflected on as they are referring in business terminology to dataset themes (or wider categories) while mappingwise they are SKOS. 
It is thus unclear if these requirements apply to a subset or to all codelists.

<h3>Provider requirements</h3>
In order to conform to this Application Profile, an application that provides metadata MUST:
<ul>
<li>Provide a description of the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified for the class <a href="#Catalogue">Catalogue</a>.</li>
<li>Provide information for the mandatory properties for <a href="#CatalogueRecord">Catalogue Records</a>, if descriptions of Catalogue Records are provided – please note that the provision of descriptions of Catalogue Records is optional.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties for the class <a href="#Dataset">Dataset</a>.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of Distributions, if any, of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties for the class <a href="#Distribution">Distribution</a>.</li>

<li>Provide descriptions of Data Services, if any, of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties for the class <a href="#DataService">Data Service</a>.</li>

<li>Provide descriptions of all organisations involved in the descriptions of Catalogue and Datasets, including at least the mandatory properties for the class <a href="#Agent">Agent</a>.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of all category schemes that contain the categories that are asserted in any of the descriptions of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified for <a href="#Conceptscheme">Conceptscheme</a>.</li>
<li>Provide descriptions of all categories involved in the descriptions of Datasets in the Catalogue, including at least the mandatory properties specified for <a href="#Concept">Concept</a>.</li>
</ul>
For the properties listed in the table in section [[[#controlled-vocs]]], the associated controlled vocabularies MUST be used. Additional controlled vocabularies MAY be used.
In addition to the mandatory properties, any of the recommended and optional properties defined in section [[[#quick-reference]]] MAY be provided.
<h3>Receiver requirements</h3>
In order to conform to this Application Profile, an application that receives metadata MUST be able to:
<li>Process information for all classes and properties specified in section [[[#quick-reference]]].</li>
<li>Process information for all controlled vocabularies specified in section [[[#controlled-vocs]]].</li>
"Processing" means that receivers must accept incoming data and transparently provide these data to applications and services. 
It does neither imply nor prescribe what applications and services finally do with the data (parse, convert, store, make searchable, display to users, etc.).

  <h2>Agent Roles</h2>

  <p class="ednote" title="integrate the following remarks">
    - reference to DCAT usage guideline https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#qualified-attribution
    - adjust to the DCAT(-AP) multiple roles that have been adopted.
    - add references to referenced resources
    - replace properties with references to properties
  </p>
 

<p>
The DCAT Application Profile specified in this document has a single property to relate an Agent (typically, an organisation) to a Dataset.
 The only such ‘agent role’ that can be expressed in the current version of the profile is through the property <a href="#Dataset.publisher">publisher</a>, defined as “An entity responsible for making the dataset available”.
A second property is available in the DCAT recommendation,<a href="#Dataset.contactpoint">contact point</a>, defined as “Link a dataset to relevant contact information which is provided using VCard”, but this is not an agent role as the value of this property is contact data, rather than a representation of the organisation as such.
In specific cases, for example in exchanging data among domain-specific portals, it may be useful to express other, more specific agent roles.
In such cases, extensions to the base profile may be defined using additional properties with more specific meanings.
</p><p>
Two possible approaches have been discussed, particular in the context of the development of the domain-specific GeoDCAT Application Profile, an extension of the base DCAT Application Profile. 
The first possible approach is based on the use of a predicate vocabulary that provides a set of properties that represent additional types of relationships between Datasets and Agents.
 For example, properties could be defined, such as foo:owner, foo:curator or foo:responsibleParty, in addition to the use of existing well-known properties, such as dct:creator and dct:rightsHolder.
 A possible source for such additional properties is the Roles Named Authority List  maintained by the Publications Office of the EU.
 Other domain-specific sources for additional properties are the INSPIRE Responsible Party roles , the Library of Congress’ MARC relators  and DataCite’s contributor types.
 To enable the use of such properties, they must be defined as RDF properties with URIs in a well-managed namespace. 
</p><p>
A second approach is based on the use of W3C’s PROV ontology [[prov-o]]  which provides a powerful mechanism to express a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. In the context of work on GeoDCAT-AP, a PROV-conformant solution for expressing agent roles was agreed . This solution uses prov:qualifiedAttribution in combination with a dct:type assertion pointing to the code list for Responsible Party Role in the INSPIRE registry. To enable the use of such types, they must be defined with URIs in a well-managed namespace. 
</p><p>
Based on the experience gained with the use of domain-specific extensions for additional ‘agent roles’ in the exchange of information about Datasets and on the requests of implementors and stakeholders, the  DCAT Application Profile release 2.0.0 is  extended with additional roles as proposed by DCAT Version 2, W3C Working Draft 28 May 2019  that have proven to be useful across domains. Precisely, properties dct:creator, prov:qualifiedAttribution and dcat:qualifiedRelation have been added to dcat:Dataset class to further facilitate relationships between datasets and agents. 
</p><p>
It should be noted that, even if a more expressive approach is used in a particular implementation, the provision of information using dct:publisher for the Catalogue is still mandatory under the rules laid down in the Conformance Statement in section [[[#conformance]]], while the provision of information using dct:publisher is strongly recommended for Dataset. The provision of such information using dct:publisher will ensure interoperability with implementations that use the basic approach of DCAT-AP.

<h2>Accessibility and Multilingual Aspects</h2>

<p>
Accessibility in the context of this Application Profile is limited to information about the technical format of distributions of datasets. The properties dcat:mediaType and dct:format provide information that can be used to determine what software can be deployed to process the data. The accessibility of the data within the datasets needs to be taken care of by the software that processes the data and is outside of the scope of this Application Profile. 
</p><p>
Multilingual aspects related to this Application Profile concern all properties whose contents are expressed as strings (i.e. rdfs:Literal) with human-readable text. Wherever such properties are used, the string values are of one of two types:
<ul>
<li>The string is free text. Examples are descriptions and labels. Such text may be translated into several languages.</li>
<li>The string is an appellation of a ‘named entity’. Examples are names of organisations or persons. These names may have parallel versions in other languages but those versions don’t need to be literal translations.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Wherever values of properties are expressed with either type of string, the property can be repeated with translations in the case of free text and with parallel versions in case of named entities. For free text, e.g. in the cases of titles, descriptions and keywords, the language tag is mandatory. 
</p><p>
Language tags to be used with rdfs:Literal are defined by BCP47 [[rfc5646]], which allows the use of the "t" extension for text transformations defined in RFC6497 [[rfc6497]] with the field "t0"  indicating a machine translation.
</p><p>
A language tag will look like: "en-t-es-t0-abcd", which conveys the information that the string is in English, translated from Spanish by machine translation using a tool named "abcd". 
</p><p>
For named entities, the language tag is optional and should only be provided if the parallel version of the name is strictly associated with a particular language. For example, the name ‘European Union’ has parallel versions in all official languages of the union, while a name like ‘W3C’ is not associated with a particular language and has no parallel versions.
</p><p>
For linking to different language versions of associated web pages (e.g. landing pages) or documentation, a content negotiation  mechanism may be used whereby different content is served based on the Accept-Languages indicated by the browser. Using such a mechanism, the link to the page or document can resolve to different language versions of the page or document.
</p><p>
All the occurrences of the property dct:language, which can be repeated if the metadata is provided in multiple languages, MUST have a URI [[rfc3986]] as their object, not a literal string from the ISO 639 code list.
</p><p>
How multilingual information is handled in systems, for example in indexing and user interfaces, is outside of the scope of this Application Profile.

<h2>Usage guide on Datasets, Distributions and Data Services</h2>
<p>
The introduction of Data Services as first class citizens in DCAT 2.0 raised questions about the usage of Data Services and Distributions. This section provides a guideline for publishers what to consider as a Distribution and what as a Data Service.
</p><p>

A first distinction between distributions and data services is their dependency on a dataset for their existance. A distribution cannot exist without its dataset. It is a specific representation of a dataset (cfr definition W3C <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#Class:Distribution">Distribution</a>). Whereas a data service is an entity in its own right. It provides access to datasets or it provides data processing functions. The independence also holds between the distributions of a dataset, and the data service which provides access to that dataset. The distributions are not required to be the result of the data service operations. However, they may.

</p><p>
Many of the properties of distributions are file oriented (downloadURL, format, byte size, checksum, modification date, ...). The relevance of this information is reduced for data services, related information is present in a very different form and thus under different terminology. For instance, data services do and can provide format transformations, language transformations and schema transformations on request. Also the handling of trust is different. While tampering of downloadable content is detected by e.g. checksums, data services create often a trusted channel using security measures such as authentication and encryption. This reduces the need for additional trust checks on the data.

</p><p>
The difference between downloading a file or accessing the data through a service have resulted in the following guidelines:
<ul>
    <li>Datasets are the conceptual entity denoting a collection of data.</li>
    <li>Distributions are specific representations of a dataset, described with the intend to facilitate the delivery of the data as file to a reuser. The access URL (preferably download URL) will provide a simple way to obtain (download) the content of the dataset in the representation specified by the distribution. The obtained (downloaded) content is fully determined by the publisher of the distribution. Only after obtaining the data the (re)user can change the data according to its needs.</li>
    <li>Anything that has not the intend to provide a downloadable representation of a dataset is a data service. Data services offer smarter, more interactive ways to the data.</li>
</ul>

</p><p>
Orthogonal to the nature clarification of distributions and data services, there might be need for a granularity clarification between datasets and distributions. Commonly, at first sight, it is expected that all distributions of a dataset are indentical in content, only differing in the representation of the data. But the when considering dataset series, this interpretation seems not valid anymore. In the upcomming release of DCAT 3.0, dataset series and dataset versioning are addressed. Implementors are advised to already take this proposal into account when creating guidelines for distributions. Note that this is less an issue between datasets and data services as both are independent entities. Data services usually address the granularity by providing the necessary query interface language so that the user can get the data according its needs.

</p><p>
These guidelines will be able to capture many access patterns, corresponding to most users' expectations. However there might be cases that are more vague. In that case the DCAT(-AP) community can be questioned for a recommended approach.

<h2>High Value Datasets</h2>

<p>
In light of the growing importance of data, the European Commission has adopted an <href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R0138">implementing act</a> focused on high-value datasets on 21 December 2022. 
The implementing regulation groups the datasets in a list of six high-value datasets thematic categories: geospatial, earth observation and environment, meteorological, statistics, companies and company ownership, and mobility. 
The <a href="https://data.europa.eu">portal for European data</a> has published an easy to read <a href="https://data.europa.eu/en/publications/datastories/high-value-datasets-overview-through-visualisation"> overview</a>.
</p>

<p>
The document XXX provides usage guidelines for DCAT-AP to meet metadata requirements expressed in the HVD implementing regulation.

  <h2>Validation of DCAT-AP</h2>

<p>
The support the check whether or not a catalogue satisfies the expressed constraints in this Application Profile, the constraints in this specification are expressed using SHACL [[shacl]].
Each constraint in this specification that could be converted into a SHACL expression has been included.
As such this collection of SHACL expressionsi that can be used to build a validation check for a data exchange between two systems. 
A typical use case is the harvesting of one catalogue into another.
</p><p>
It is up to the implementers of the data exchange to define the validation they expect.
Each data exchange happens within a context, and that context is beyond the SHACL expressions here.
</p><p>
For instance, it might be known that the exchanged data does not contain the details of the organisations, as they are all uniquely identified by a deferenceable URI.
In such case, the rules regarding the check of the mandatory existence of a name for each organisation is probably not relevant. 
A strict execution of the DCAT-AP SHACL expressions will raise errors, although the data is available through a different channel.
In this example, it is valid to not include this check in this validation step. 
</p><p>
The example illustrates that in order to get the right user experience of a validation process, one has to consider what is actually transferred between the systems.
And use the constraints that are in scope of the data exchange.
To assist this process the SHACL expressions are grouped in distinct files, matching already typical validation setups.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>dcat-ap_2.1.1_shacl_shapes.ttl: constraints concerning existance, domain and literal range, and cardinalities. </li>
    <li>dcat-ap_2.1.1_shacl_range.ttl: constraints concerning object range. </li>
    <li>dcat-ap_2.1.1_shacl_mdr-vocabularies.shape.ttl: constraints concerning the usage of controlled vocabularies.</li>
</ul>

The first file provides for each class mentioned in DCAT-AP and having additional properties defined a template with the corresponding constraints. Class membership constraints are not present in the first fil. These are collected in the second file.

<ul>
   <li>dcat-ap_2.1.1_shacl_shapes_recommended.ttl: constraints concerning existance of recommended properties.</li>
</ul>

In order to validate a catalogue additional data might be required to import into the validator, such as the controlled vocabularies. These have to be retrieved from the appropriate places. As support, the following files express the imports (not transitive) according to the SHACL specification, which can be loaded into the ISA testbed.

<ul>
    <li>dcat-ap_2.1.1_shacl_imports.ttl: imports the vocabulary knowledge.</li>
    <li>dcat-ap_2.1.1_shacl_mdr_imports.ttl: imports the recommended codelists.</li>
</ul>

The shacl files are configured in this instance of the Interoperable Europe testbed: https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/shacl/dcat-ap/upload. More information about the configured validation profiles is https://github.com/ISAITB/validator-resources-dcat-ap.
