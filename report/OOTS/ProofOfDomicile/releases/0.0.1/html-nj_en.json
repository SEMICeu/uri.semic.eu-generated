Providing a simple country name is problematic and should be avoided whereas using a standardised system that allows the use of a code list for country names has a lot of potential for increasing semantic interoperability. Known diversity that one has to deal with when exchanging country names between different communication partners without relying on an agreed code list are: (a) long form vs. short form of a country name (e.g. Federal Republic of Germany vs. Germany), (b) different languages (Italy vs. Italia), (c) historic name vs. current name (Burma vs. Myanmar), (d) ambiguity of similar sounding countries (Republic of the Congo vs. Democratic Republic of the Congo). The Publications Office of the European Union recommends and uses <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/72482.html\">ISO 3166-1</a> codes for countries in all cases except two: use 'UK' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GB for the United Kingdom; use 'EL' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GR for Greece.
