Known diversity that one has to deal with when exchanging country names between different communication partners without relying on an agreed code list are: (a) long form vs. short form of a country name (e.g. Federal Republic of Germany vs. Germany), (b) different languages (Italy vs. Italia), (c) historic name vs. current name (Burma vs. Myanmar), (d) ambiguity of similar sounding countries (Republic of the Congo vs. Democratic Republic of the Congo).
