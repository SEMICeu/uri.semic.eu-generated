            "note": "In general, Criteria are used for comparison, filtering or selection purposes. Criteria usually set minimum conditions (e.g. limits, intervals, thresholds, etc.) that need to be met in order to pass the requirements or to fulfil them to a certain degree or quality. The concept of Criteria is broader than the concept of Constraint since it covers more usages. The evaluation of the fulfilment is usually supported by the provision of Evidence. \r\nFor example in the eProcurement domain, the eProcurement Ontology defines different subclasses of Criterion such as exclusion grounds, selection criteria or award criteria. A concrete example of a Criterion is 'participation in a criminal organisation' which could also be considered as an exclusion ground criterion in the procurement domain or for requiring a public service."

Providing a simple country name is problematic and should be avoided whereas using a standardised system that allows the use of a code list for country names has a lot of potential for increasing semantic interoperability. Known diversity that one has to deal with when exchanging country names between different communication partners without relying on an agreed code list are: (a) long form vs. short form of a country name (e.g. Federal Republic of Germany vs. Germany), (b) different languages (Italy vs. Italia), (c) historic name vs. current name (Burma vs. Myanmar), (d) ambiguity of similar sounding countries (Republic of the Congo vs. Democratic Republic of the Congo).
