Even within countries, there are almost always examples of Addresses that do not conform to the stated national standard. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iso.org\/standard\/61710.html\">ISO 19160-1<\/a> provides a method through which different Addresses can be converted from one conceptual model to another.\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nThis specification was heavily based on the INSPIRE Address Representation data type. It is noteworthy that if an Address is provided using the detailed breakdown suggested by the properties for this class, then it will be INSPIRE-conformant. To this very granular set of properties, we add two further properties:\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\n- full address (the complete address as a formatted string)<br\/>\r\n- addressID (a unique identifier for the address).\r\nThe first of these allows publishers to simply provide the complete Address as one string, with or without formatting.
