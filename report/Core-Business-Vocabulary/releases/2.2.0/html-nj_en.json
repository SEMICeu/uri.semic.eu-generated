The activity of a company should be recorded using a controlled vocabulary. Several such vocabularies exist, many of which map to the UN's <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Econ/ISIC.cshtml\">ISIC</a> codes. Where a particular controlled vocabulary is in use within a given context, such as <a href=\"https://resources.companieshouse.gov.uk/sic/\">SIC codes</a> in the UK, it is acceptable to use these, however, the preferred choice for European interoperability is <a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/nace2\">NACE</a>."
