Even within countries, there are almost always examples of Addresses that do not conform to the stated national standard.

It is noteworthy that if an Address is provided using the detailed breakdown suggested by the properties for this class, then it will be INSPIRE-conformant. To this very granular set of properties, we add two further properties:\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n- full address (the complete address as a formatted string)<br/>\r\n- addressID (a unique identifier for the address).\r\nThe first of these allows publishers to simply provide the complete Address as one string, with or without formatting.

These might be tailored to the specific need of the dataset, follow a national norm, or make use of a standard like vCard.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nTo provide maximum flexibility in the Core Vocabulary, whilst remaining interoperable with INSPIRE Address Guidelines (which EU Member States are obliged to use), the  Core Location Vocabulary provides the extra property of full address and makes use of INSPIRE's addressID.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe datatype of addressID is indicated as Literal (keeping backward compatibility with the old W3C specification) that can be typed differently, see <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal\">more</a>.\r\n"
