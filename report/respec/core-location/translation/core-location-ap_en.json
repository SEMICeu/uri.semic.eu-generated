Taking the example used in the <a href=\"https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/Data_Specifications/INSPIRE_DataSpecification_GN_v3.0.1.pdf\">INSPIRE document</a> (page 18), the following are all valid geographic names for the Greek capital:\r\n- \"A&theta;n&nu;a\"@gr-Grek (the Greek endonym written in the Greek script)\r\n- \"Athína\"@gr-Latn (the standard Romanisation of the endonym)\r\n- \"Athens\"@en (the English language exonym)\r\nINSPIRE has a detailed (XML-based) method of providing metadata about a geographic name and in XML-data sets that may be the most appropriate method to follow.
