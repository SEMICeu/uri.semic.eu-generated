The response to an Information Requirement is an Evidence when the issuer of the response is an authoritative source (e.g. a Civil Registry providing data about a natural person for the provision of public service through the Single Digital Gateway). In other cases, the responses might not be issued by an authoritative source, but the issuer supports the responses with Evidences (or commits to support them timely, e.g. a self-declaration or a declaration of oath). The Information Requirement can require structured data or documents of any form. For structured data, the Requirement can use 'Concepts' to specify the structure and type of the data expected in the response.

For instance, this can be by defining their own datatypes extending or encapsulating common xsd datatypes. But also by using more complex languages such as <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/\">XPath</a>, <a href=\"https://www.omg.org/spec/OCL/\">Object Constraint Language</a> (OCL), <a href=\"https://www.javascript.com/\">JavaScript</a> and <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/rif-overview/\">Rule Interchange Format</a> (RIF).\r\nBecause of this freedom, implementers are recommended to well-document their usage of this property (and related information). \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

The full name is the most reliable label for an individual and as such its use is strongly encouraged, irrespective of whether that name is broken down using the more granular elements.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIt is anticipated that some systems will only provide or process the full name of a person. Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once. In this case, however, the granular name elements should not be used since the intention is that these provide a breakdown of the full name and it will not be clear of which full name this is true. Note that the vocabulary provides an alternative name property. This allows name(s) to be recorded that have no legal status but that nevertheless are the names by which an individual is generally known.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nA name usually sticks with a person for a long time period. In some European countries a name may only be changed according to certain laws and life events, e.g. marriage. The name denominates a natural person even if he/she changes their address. Documents like birth certificate or diploma usually don't carry an address but always the name. Thus the name is one of the core attributes. However it is not sufficient to identify a person since there are combinations of very common names like Smith in the UK, Meier in Germany, or Li in China."
