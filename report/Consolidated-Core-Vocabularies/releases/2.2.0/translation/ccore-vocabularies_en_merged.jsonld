INSPIRE's definition is the following: Names of areas, regions, localities, cities, suburbs, towns or settlements, or any geographical or topographical feature of public or historical interest. This is beyond what is necessary for the Core Location Vocabulary but, importantly, the concept of a geographic name used here is consistent.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nA geographic name is a proper noun applied to a spatial object. Taking the example used in the <a href=\"https://knowledge-base.inspire.ec.europa.eu/publications/inspire-data-specification-geographical-names-technical-guidelines_en\">INSPIRE document</a> (page 18), the following are all valid geographic names for the Greek capital:\r\n- \"A&theta;n&nu;a\"@gr-Grek (the Greek endonym written in the Greek script)\r\n- \"Athína\"@gr-Latn (the standard Romanisation of the endonym)\r\n- \"Athens\"@en (the English language exonym)\r\nINSPIRE has a detailed (XML-based) method of providing metadata about a geographic name and in XML-data sets that may be the most appropriate method to follow. When using the Core Location Vocabulary in data sets that are not focussed on environmental/geographical data (the use case for INSPIRE), the Code datatype or a simple language identifier may be used to provide such metadata.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe country codes defined in <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html\">ISO 3166</a> may be used as geographic names and these are generally preferred over either the long form or short form of a country's name (as they are less error prone). The Publications Office of the European Union recommends the use of <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/72482.html\">ISO 3166-1</a> codes for countries in all cases except two:\r\n- use 'UK' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GB for the United Kingdom;\r\n- use 'EL' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GR for Greece.\r\nWhere a country has changed its name or no longer exists (such as Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia etc.) use the ISO 3166-3 code.",
