Even within countries, there are almost always examples of Addresses that do not conform to the stated national standard. However, <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/61710.html\">ISO 19160-1</a> provides a method through which different Addresses can be converted from one conceptual model to another.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis specification was heavily based on the INSPIRE Address Representation data type. It is noteworthy that if an Address is provided using the detailed breakdown suggested by the properties for this class, then it will be INSPIRE-conformant. To this very granular set of properties, we add two further properties:\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n- full address (the complete address as a formatted string)<br/>\r\n- addressID (a unique identifier for the address).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe first of these allows publishers to simply provide the complete Address as one string, with or without formatting. This is analogous to <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf/#d4e953\">vCard's label property</a>.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe addressID is part of the <a href=\"https://knowledge-base.inspire.ec.europa.eu/index_en\">INSPIRE guidelines</a> and provides a hook that can be used to link the Address to an alternative representation, such as <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf\">vCard</a> or <a href=\"https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ciq/ciq.html#6\">OASIS xAL.</a>\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis class belongs to <a href=\"https://semiceu.github.io/Core-Location-Vocabulary/\">Core Location Vocabulary</a>"

It is the address Identifier that allows an address to be represented in a format other than INSPIRE whilst remaining conformant to the Core Vocabulary.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe <a href=\"https://knowledge-base.inspire.ec.europa.eu/index_en\">INSPIRE</a> method of representing addresses is very detailed, designed primarily for use in databases of addresses. Whilst data that is published in full conformance with the INSPIRE data structure can be made available using the<a href=\"https://semiceu.github.io/Core-Location-Vocabulary/\">Core Location Vocabulary</a> the reverse is not true since the Core Vocabulary allows much greater flexibility.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nMany datasets that include address data as one piece of information about something else are likely to have that data in simpler formats. These might be tailored to the specific need of the dataset, follow a national norm, or make use of a standard like vCard.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nTo provide maximum flexibility in the Core Vocabulary, whilst remaining interoperable with <a href=\"https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/inspire/solution/inspire-data-specifications-addresses-guidelines-v301\">INSPIRE Address Guidelines</a> (which EU Member States are obliged to use), the  Core Location Vocabulary provides the extra property of full address and makes use of INSPIRE's addressID.\r\n\r\n"
